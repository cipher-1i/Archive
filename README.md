<h3><a href="https://github.com/redalgorithm/IO-Redirection">Input/Output Redirection</a></h3>
<p>This program tests input/output redirection using the following long options:<br/>
--input for specifying a file as standard input<br/>
--output for creating and using a file as standard output<br/>
--segfault for forcing a segmentation fault<br/>
--catch for registering a SIGSEGV handler that catches the fault</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/redalgorithm/Automatrix/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20-Esque/Mastermind%20Board%20Game">Mastermind (board game)</a></h3>
<p>This program represents a virtual game of mastermind using the XCode IDE in C++.<br/>
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.  Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs (pins) on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from one to N key pegs (pegs) in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored or black peg (1) is placed for each pin from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white peg (0) is placed for each pin from the guess which is the correct color but found in a different position. All guesses for which a peg is left empty (-1) is considered completely incorrect.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/200106-UTA-PRS-NET/P1-Shaanan-Curtis">PizzaBox (web app)</a></h3>
<p>Full Stack web application using a scaffolded SQL Server DB via Entity Framework for Data Access and a Repository Design Pattern for loose coupling of project and modularization of CRUD operations. Deals with dependency injections using built-in methods from ASP.NET MVC.  The MVC architecture provides looser coupling of application, separating UI from business logic and data access. This application utilizes CI CD Pipelines and has been fully deployed through Azure's cloud services.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/200106-UTA-PRS-NET/P2-Viewz">Viewz (RESTful service)</a></h3>
<p>Viewz API is a RESTful service built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 that takes markdown as input and generates a Wiki on output. It consumes Markdown by Github and parses the result for a cleaner and more optimal HTML conversion within the context of Wiki page generation. Maximum size of input per conversion is 400KB, which provides a large workspace for large projects. Client-side operations are handled using Angular, including the Angular HttpClient for consumption of Viewz. While working on this project, collectively generated a code coverage greater than 80%.</p>
